# ui-challenge-2

CSS Sprites-  are a means of combining multiple images into a single image file for use on a website, to help with performance.

Images are fethced from the same file making it faster and more effiecient than fethcing multiple file images.

#Data URIs
Data URIs allow you to embed the image data directly into a stylesheet. This avoids additional HTTP requests for images, making it essentially the same thing as a sprite, without the fancy positioning.
